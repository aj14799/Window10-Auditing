### =================// More About Windows Auditing \\\\======================


=> Security auditing is one of the most powerful tools that we can use to maintain the integrity of our system. As part of our overall security strategy, we can determine the level of auditing that is appropriate for our environment. Auditing should identify attacks (successful or not) that pose a threat to our network, and attacks against resources that we have determined to be valuable in our risk assessment.

1. Basic security audit policies :- Before we implement auditing, we must decide on an auditing policy. A basic audit policy specifies categories of security-related events that we want to audit. When the versions of Windows 10 is first installed, all auditing categories are disabled. By enabling various auditing event categories, we can implement an auditing policy that suits the security needs of your organization.

2. Advanced security audit policy settings :- 
        1. A group administrator has modified settings or data on servers that contain finance information.
        2. An employee within a defined group has accessed an important file.
        3. The correct system access control list (SACL) is applied to every file and folder or registry key on a computer or file share           as a verifiable safeguard against undetected access.
You can access these audit policy settings through the Local Security Policy snap-in (secpol.msc) on the local computer or by using Group Policy.
